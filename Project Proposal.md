My project is a Portfolio website about me. I am making this webpage to have a basic portfolio page. I am making it to be able to upgrade the website in the future and use it as my portfolio page. I will be including my contact information and links to a few of my projects.
Prior art:  Other projects could be any other portfolio page.
Core User Workflows: I will not be trying to add too many pictures or projects. I will be making sure to show my 2 unit projects and a codepen survey webpage I made.

Tuesday:
 * I will begin to make my basic layout and my navbar
Wednesday:
 * I will get my navbar completed and my projects on my webpage
 * I will add my contact information with buttons
Thursday:
 * I will make sure it is easily viewable on all platforms and that the mobile layout will be working
 * I will also add all images and finalize all of my projects
